## Overview - What is Supe Project Creator?

Supe Project Creator is a simple tool designed to help you build simple web applications quickly and efficiently. It generates project templates boilerplate using **TypeScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, with included **hot reloading** for a seamless development workflow. But there's a catch - the generated project has no dependencies, a fresh start. All the source code that runs the project will be waiting for you in the generated project folder, no strings attached. It's as simple as you can get.

The tool comes with a **built-in web server**, making it easy to test and deploy your projects locally or in production. One of the standout features is an optional pre-configured **AI DEMO** that showcases object detection in images, demonstrating the integration of machine learning in web apps.

> [!NOTE]
> The created project is client-only. You are welcome to combine Supe Project Creator with any other server framework, such as Express.JS, FastAPI, Cloudflare Workers, etc.

**For a bit of technical detail:** how it does all of that is thanks to the built-in TypeScript compilers in the new runtimes. This approach uses globally installed `http-server`, `nodemon`, and `esbuild` packages, eliminating the need for additional dependency downloads.

> [!CAUTION]
> The package is not production-ready yet.

## Prerequisites - What do you need to run Supe Project Creator?

Before executing any scripts, please take a moment to:

1. **Read this entire document** to understand the necessary steps and requirements.
2. **Verify that you have installed** the required runtime: `bun` | `deno 2` | `node`

> [!WARNING]
> Deno support for this package is currently actively worked on.
> Node support will probably never work due to a missing built-in TypeScript compiler.

## ðŸ›  Getting Started - Usage - Quickstart - Tutorial

To start using Supe Project Creator, simply run the following command:

### Create a Clean Project in the Current Working Directory:

```bash
deno jsr:@supeprojects/supe-project-creator@1.8.2 -n @example/my-supe-project --runtime deno
```

```bash
cd my-supe-project
```

### Create an AI Demo Project in the Current Working Directory:

```bash
deno jsr:@supeprojects/supe-project-creator@1.8.2 --demo -n @example/cat-dog-detector -r deno
```

```bash
cd cat-dog-detector
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Supe Project Creator does not require a separate installation step. Simply execute the command above to create a new project instantly.

Once you're inside the project directory, you can then follow the steps to install dependencies and start the development server:

1. **Install Dependencies**:

```bash
bun install
# or..
deno install
```

2. **Start the Development Server**:

```bash
bun start
# or..
deno run start
```

Now a new browser tab will open, directing you to `http://localhost` if it isn't already open. This allows you to immediately view and interact with your project in your web browser.

This behavior is, of course, configurable in `hotreload/config.ts`, allowing you to customize the browser launch, hot reload, port or other settings according to your project's requirements.

> [!TIP]
> **Recommended Extensions for Visual Studio Code**
>
> - **Deno**: The official Deno extension for Visual Studio Code provides features like syntax highlighting, code completion, linting, and debugging support for Deno projects.  
>   [Install Deno](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno)
>
> - **Biome**: A fast and flexible linter, formatter, and style checker for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, and more, ensuring clean and consistent code formatting.  
>   [Install Biome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome)
>
> - **JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly**: Access nightly builds of the TypeScript language service, allowing you to use the latest features and fixes.  
>   [Install JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next)
>
> **Manual Installation Steps:**
> 1. Open VSCode and navigate to Extensions (`Ctrl + Shift + X`).
> 2. Search for the name of the desired extension (e.g., "Deno", "Biome", or "JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly").
> 3. Select the extension and click **Install**.

> - **Streamlined view**: Concentrate on your project's essential files, without clutter from `node_modules` and other irrelevant directories.
> - **Improved performance**: By excluding unnecessary files, you'll experience faster loading times and more efficient search results.

## Programmatic Usage

The Supe Project Creator (SPC) can be utilized programmatically within your TypeScript or JavaScript applications. This allows you to create projects dynamically and customize the initialization process according to your needs.

### Benefits of Programmatic Use

Utilizing SPC programmatically allows you to:

- **Automate Project Creation**: Integrate project setup into your build scripts or development tools.
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Enhance your development workflow by reducing manual steps in project creation.

#### Programmatic Use Example

```ts
import SPC from 'jsr:@supeprojects/supe-project-creator@1.8.2';

console.log("Testing SPC programmatically...");

// Display the help menu
SPC([]);

// Create a new clean project named "my-example-project"
SPC(['--name', '@example/my-example-project', '--runtime', 'deno']);

// Create a project with specific runtime and additional options (May soon be replaced with an argument instead of a variable)
SPC(['--name', '@example/my-custom-project', '--runtime', 'deno']);

// Generate a project and immediately start the development server - Not implemented yet! TODO: Implement --start script
// SPC(['--name', '@example/my-fast-project', '--start', '--runtime', 'deno']);
```

### Programmatic Use Parameters

- `argv: string[]`: An array of command-line arguments that control the behavior of the project creation process. This includes options like `--name` for naming the project, and the `--runtime` option to specify the environment (e.g., `bun`, `deno`, or `node`).
