# Supe Project Creator

A powerful tool for creating modern web projects with batteries included.

[JSR](https://jsr.io/@supeprojects/supe-project-creator)

**Important Note:** Deno support is currently untested and not recommended for use at this time. For a stable experience, we recommend using Bun until Deno support is fully implemented and tested.

## Overview

Supe Project Creator is a comprehensive tool designed to help you build modern web applications quickly and efficiently. It generates project templates using **TypeScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, with included **hot reloading** for a seamless development workflow. 

**Note:** The created project is client-only. You are welcome to combine Super Project Creator with any other server framework, such as Express.JS, FastAPI, Cloudflare Workers, etc.

The tool comes with a **built-in web server**, making it easy to test and deploy your projects locally or in production. One of the standout features is a pre-configured **AI demo** that showcases object detection in images, demonstrating the integration of machine learning in web apps.

## Usage

**Note**: JSR currently does not support NPX or BUNX-style direct execution, but `--global` installation may be available soon. Feel free to suggest a better approach if you find one.

To start using Supe Project Creator, run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir supe-project-creator
cd supe-project-creator
bun init -y
bunx jsr add @supeprojects/supe-project-creator@latest
```

### Displaying Available Options

To view the available options for Supe Project Creator, run the following command:

#### Using Bun
```bash
bun ./node_modules/@supeprojects/supe-project-creator --help
```

#### Using Deno
```bash
deno ./node_modules/@supeprojects/supe-project-creator --help
```
**Note:** Deno support is currently untested, but it will be fully supported in the future.

#### Using Node
```bash
node ./node_modules/@supeprojects/supe-project-creator --help
```
**Note:** Node currently has limitations due to missing built-in TypeScript compatibility, but the above command will still work.

### Future Command (ðŸ¤ž):
```bash
jsx supe-project-creator [options]
```

## Options

- `-h`, `--help`: Displays help information.
- `-v`, `--version`: Displays the version number.
- `-n`, `--name <string>`: Sets the project name (default: `"example-project"`).
- `-d`, `--demo`: Creates a demo project (default: `false`).

## Example Use Cases

- **Create a new project with a custom name at a specific path:**

```bash
bun ./node_modules/@supeprojects/supe-project-creator -n "C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\my-supe-project"
```

- **Create a new project folder with a custom name in the current directory:**

```bash
bun ./node_modules/@supeprojects/supe-project-creator -n my-supe-project
```

- **Create a demo project:**

```bash
bun ./node_modules/@supeprojects/supe-project-creator --demo --name cat-dog-detector
```

## Getting Started

After creating a new project using the Supe Project Creator, you will first need to navigate to the newly created project directory before proceeding with the setup. This ensures you're working inside the correct folder where all project files are stored.

For example, after running the command to create the project, navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\my-supe-project"
```

Once you're inside the project directory, you can then follow the steps to install dependencies and start the development server:

1. **Install Dependencies**:

```bash
bun install
```

2. **Start the Development Server**:

```bash
bun start
```

After navigating to the project folder and running the command to start the development server with `bun start`, a new browser tab will open, directing you to `http://localhost:80` if it isn't already open. This allows you to immediately view and interact with your project in your web browser.

This behavior is, of course, configurable in `hotreload/config.ts`, allowing you to customize the port or other settings according to your project's requirements.

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:80`.

## Project Structure

Supe Project Creator organizes your project using the following structure:

- `src`: Contains the project's source code (TypeScript).
- `public`: Public-facing files, including `index.html`.
- `hotreload`: Configuration and scripts for hot reloading.

### Recommended Workspace Configuration

To enhance your development experience, we provide a recommended `.code-workspace` file named after your project. This configuration excludes unnecessary files from view, allowing you to focus on your code.

**Opening the Workspace:**

1. Locate the `<project-name>.code-workspace` file in your project directory.
2. Double-click the file to open it in VS Code, or select "Open Workspace" from the VS Code menu and navigate to the file.

**Benefits of Using the Recommended Workspace:**

* Streamlined view: Concentrate on your project's essential files, without clutter from `node_modules` and other irrelevant directories.
* Improved performance: By excluding unnecessary files, you'll experience faster loading times and more efficient search results.
