# Supe Project Creator v1.6.3

A simple tool for creating modern web projects with batteries included.

![Supe Project Creator - AI Demo Project](https://github.com/burgil/burgil/blob/main/public/Supe-Project-Creator-Gif.gif?raw=true)

This is the first package under the @supeprojects scope, with more planned for the future.

## Overview - What is Supe Project Creator?

Supe Project Creator is a simple tool designed to help you build modern web applications quickly and efficiently. It generates project templates boilerplate using **TypeScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, with included **hot reloading** for a seamless development workflow. But there's a catch - the generated project has no dependencies, a fresh start. All the source code that runs the project will be waiting for you in the generated project folder, no strings attached. It's as simple as you can get.

[JSR](https://jsr.io/@supeprojects/supe-project-creator) - [Source Code](https://github.com/burgil/supe-project-creator) - [Known Issues](https://github.com/burgil/supe-project-creator/issues) - [Docs/Wiki](https://github.com/burgil/supe-project-creator/wiki)

**For a bit of technical detail:** how it does all of that is thanks to the built-in TypeScript compilers in the new runtimes. To avoid downloading dependencies, it uses `bunx` (an `npx` alternative) to fetch packages like `http-server`, `nodemon`, and `esbuild`.

> [!NOTE]
> The created project is client-only. You are welcome to combine Supe Project Creator with any other server framework, such as Express.JS, FastAPI, Cloudflare Workers, etc.

The tool comes with a **built-in web server**, making it easy to test and deploy your projects locally or in production. One of the standout features is a pre-configured **AI DEMO** that showcases object detection in images, demonstrating the integration of machine learning in web apps.

**Unlock Your Productivity**

By utilizing Supe Project Creator, you can:

* **Save Time**: Skip tedious configuration tasks and jumpstart your project with a pre-configured template.
* **Boost Efficiency**: Focus on writing code, not setting up your project structure.
* **Streamline Your Workflow**: Take advantage of hot reloading and instant feedback to accelerate your development process.
* **Explore New Possibilities**: Leverage the included AI demo to experiment with machine learning in your web applications.

With Supe Project Creator, you can concentrate on what matters most â€“ building innovative and effective web applications.

## Prerequisites - What do you need to run Supe Project Creator?

Before executing any scripts, please take a moment to:

1. **Read this entire document** to understand the necessary steps and requirements.
2. **Verify that you have installed** the required dependencies:
	* `bun`
	* `deno 2`
	* `node`
3. **Verify ESBuild Functionality** in Your Environment:
	* Run the command `bunx esbuild --version` to check the installed version. At the time of writing, the expected output is `0.24.0`.
	* You can also check this with `deno`, Run the command `deno npm:esbuild --version`, the expected output is:
	`âœ… Granted all env access.`
	`âœ… Granted all read access.`
	`âœ… Granted all run access.`
	`0.24.0`

By doing so, you will ensure a smooth and successful execution of the scripts.

## ðŸ›  Getting Started - Usage - Quickstart - Tutorial

To start using Supe Project Creator, simply run the following command:

### Create an AI Demo Project in the Current Working Directory:
```bash
deno jsr:@supeprojects/supe-project-creator --demo -n cat-dog-detector
```

### Create a Clean Project in the Current Working Directory:
```bash
deno jsr:@supeprojects/supe-project-creator -n my-supe-project
```

### Create a Clean Project in a Specific Directory:
```bash
deno jsr:@supeprojects/supe-project-creator --name "C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\my-supe-project"
```

> [!TIP]
> TODO: Add runtime argument `--bun`, `--deno` or `--node`

If you get any error related to `esbuild` during usage, Try to restart the terminal and try again, To avoid downloading dependencies it uses `bunx` (`NPX` Alternative) to fetch packages like `http-server`, `nodemon` and `esbuild`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Supe Project Creator does not require a separate installation step. Simply execute the command above to create a new project instantly. In future releases, it will also be available as a package, allowing you to write custom code that generates projects programmatically. (**Work in Progress**). To test this feature, run `bun test` in your terminal.

After creating a new project using the Supe Project Creator, you will first need to navigate to the newly created project directory before proceeding with the setup:

#### For a project created in a specific directory:
```bash
cd "C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\my-supe-project"
```

#### For a project created in the current working directory (e.g., AI demo):
```bash
cd cat-dog-detector
```

Once you're inside the project directory, you can then follow the steps to install dependencies and start the development server:

1. **Install Dependencies**:

```bash
bun install
# or
deno install # (Deno is not tested yet)
```

2. **Start the Development Server**:

```bash
bun start
# or
deno start # (Deno is not tested yet)
```

After navigating to the project folder and running the command to start the development server with `bun start`, a new browser tab will open, directing you to `http://localhost` if it isn't already open. This allows you to immediately view and interact with your project in your web browser.

This behavior is, of course, configurable in `hotreload/config.ts`, allowing you to customize the port or other settings according to your project's requirements.

> [!TIP]
> ### Recommended Extensions for Visual Studio Code
>
> - **Deno**: The official Deno extension for Visual Studio Code provides features like syntax highlighting, code completion, linting, and debugging support for Deno projects.  
>   [Install Deno](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno)
>
> - **Biome**: A fast and flexible linter, formatter, and style checker for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, and more, ensuring clean and consistent code formatting.  
>   [Install Biome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biomejs.biome)
>
> - **JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly**: Access nightly builds of the TypeScript language service, allowing you to use the latest features and fixes.  
>   [Install JavaScript and TypeScript Nightly](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next)

> 2. Double-click the file to open it in VS Code, or find "Open Workspace" inside VS Code.
>
> **Benefits of Using the Recommended VSCode Workspace:**
> - **Streamlined view**: Concentrate on your project's essential files, without clutter from `node_modules` and other irrelevant directories.
> - **Improved performance**: By excluding unnecessary files, you'll experience faster loading times and more efficient search results.

## Programmatic Usage

The Supe Project Creator (SPC) can be utilized programmatically within your TypeScript or JavaScript applications. This allows you to create projects dynamically and customize the initialization process according to your needs.

### Benefits of Programmatic Use

Utilizing SPC programmatically allows you to:

- **Automate Project Creation**: Integrate project setup into your build scripts or development tools.
- **Customize Parameters**: Tailor the initialization process with specific options that suit your project needs. TODO: Add more options
- **Streamlined Workflow**: Enhance your development workflow by reducing manual steps in project creation.
### Importing and Installing Supe Project Creator

#### Programmatic Use Example

```ts
import SPC from 'jsr:@supeprojects/supe-project-creator';

console.log("Testing SPC programmatically...");

// Display the help menu
SPC([]);

// Create a new clean project named "my-example-project"
SPC(['--name', 'my-example-project']);

// Create a project with specific runtime and additional options (May soon be replaced with an argument instead of a variable)
SPC(['--name', 'my-custom-project'], 'deno');

// Generate a project and immediately start the development server - Not implemented yet! TODO: Implement --start script
// SPC(['--name', 'my-fast-project', '--start']);
```

### Programmatic Use Parameters

- `argv: string[]`: An array of command-line arguments that control the behavior of the project creation process. This includes options like `--name` for naming the project, and in the future, it might have a `--runtime` option to specify the environment (e.g., `bun`, `deno`, or `node`) or `--bun`, `--deno`, and `--node`.
- `runtime: 'bun' | 'deno' | 'node'`: The runtime environment for the project creation process. It defaults to `'bun'`. You can specify which environment to use by passing one of these values.

For more detailed information on available options and flags, refer to the [CLI Options](#cli-options) section of the documentation.

Depending on the runtime environment you're using, you can import the `Supe Project Creator` (SPC) in different ways. Below are examples for **Deno**, **Node**, and **Bun**.

**Bump Version Script**
---------------

As a contributor to this project, you may need to update the version number of your own fork or local copy. The following steps outline how to do so.

The `bump.ts` script is executed by either `bun` or `deno` to increment the version number of a project, by updating the relevant files such as `package.json`.

Automations. Algorithms. Everywhere.

![Bump Version Script](https://github.com/burgil/burgil/blob/main/public/version-bump-script-screenshots/version-bump-script-screenshot1.png?raw=true)

**Inspecting the Final Commit of the Automation Script:**
---------------

The following screenshots demonstrate the changes made by the version bump script:

![Bump Version Script Commit Example - README.md](https://github.com/burgil/burgil/blob/main/public/version-bump-script-screenshots/version-bump-script-screenshot2.png?raw=true) ![Bump Version Script Commit Example - index.ts](https://github.com/burgil/burgil/blob/main/public/version-bump-script-screenshots/version-bump-script-screenshot3.png?raw=true) ![Bump Version Script Commit Example - jsr.json](https://github.com/burgil/burgil/blob/main/public/version-bump-script-screenshots/version-bump-script-screenshot4.png?raw=true) ![Bump Version Script Commit Example - package.json](https://github.com/burgil/burgil/blob/main/public/version-bump-script-screenshots/version-bump-script-screenshot5.png?raw=true)

**Running the Bump Version Script**
---------------

To run the bump version script in your own local environment, use one of the following commands:

- To run with `bun`, execute: 
```bash
bun bump
```

- To run with `deno`, execute: 
```bash
deno bump.ts
```
**Note:** Currently, `deno` bumping is not functioning as expected. It prompts for permissions, but then hangs on the readline input.

### Old Examples

- **Create a new project with a custom name at a specific path:**

```bash
bun ./node_modules/@supeprojects/supe-project-creator -n "C:\Users\%username%\Desktop\my-supe-project"
```

- **Create a new project folder with a custom name in the current directory:**

```bash
bun ./node_modules/@supeprojects/supe-project-creator -n my-supe-project
```

- **Create a demo project:**

```bash
bun ./node_modules/@supeprojects/supe-project-creator --demo --name cat-dog-detector
```

## Old Usage - How to run with Bun instead of Deno?

> [!IMPORTANT]
> JSR currently does not support NPX or BUNX-style direct execution, but `--global` installation may be available soon. Feel free to suggest a better approach if you find one.

To start using Supe Project Creator, run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir supe-project-creator
cd supe-project-creator
bun init -y
bunx jsr add @supeprojects/supe-project-creator@latest
```

```bash
deno ./node_modules/@supeprojects/supe-project-creator --help
```
**Note:** Deno support is currently untested, but it will be fully supported in the future.

#### Using Node
```bash
node ./node_modules/@supeprojects/supe-project-creator --help
```
**Note:** Node currently has limitations due to missing built-in TypeScript compatibility, but the above command will still work.

npx supeprojects__supe-project-creator

$env:npm_config_registry="https://npm.jsr.io/@jsr/"
bunx supeprojects__supe-project-creator

# Without JSR: (Temporary solution until another method is discovered)
bunx burgil/supe-project-creator
npx github:burgil/supe-project-creator
```
